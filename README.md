# figure_extraction_task

## Requirements

- Python 2 (2.7.9 is used for development)
- TODO: Find a suitable DB

## Overview

The task is to extract values from the graph plot in png files. The data is given by many folders, each name following the pattern project_*. Inside each folder, ~_dailybackers.png ~_dailypledges.png are to be extracted. For each plot, the horizontal axis specifies the date and there is one column for each date. Each column is tagged with a number and the task is to extract those numbers and store them into the database.

## Algorithms to extract number

As current library on the Internet cannot properly extract figures for this task, we have to devise an algorithm to extract numbers.
